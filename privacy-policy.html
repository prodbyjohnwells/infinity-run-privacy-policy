  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>While <em>Infinity Run</em> itself does not collect personally identifiable information (PII), the game integrates several third-party services that may collect certain data automatically as part of their functionality:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Games Services</strong>: used for leaderboards and achievements. This may access your Google Play Games profile (including display name and ID).</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In</strong>: used for authentication. This may collect your name, email, and profile image if you choose to sign in.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>: supports user login (via Google Sign-In).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Realtime Database</strong>: stores and syncs non-PII gameplay data such as scores and progress.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>: collects anonymous app usage data (device type, OS version, in-game events).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Performance Monitoring</strong>: tracks app performance and device characteristics (e.g., network speed, app startup time).</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics</strong>: collects crash logs and diagnostic information to improve app stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: displays ads that may be personalized or contextual. AdMob may collect device information (e.g., IP address, advertising ID, interactions).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>All data collected by these services is governed by their own privacy policies. Learn more here:

  </p>

  <p> If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You will be prompted to provide explicit consent for the use of personal data such as personalized ads or analytics. You may withdraw your consent at any time through your device settings or by contacting us. You can also manage or revoke your consent at any time through the “Privacy Settings” button located in the app’s Settings menu. This allows users in GDPR regions to easily update their preferences regarding personalized ads and data usage.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use This Information</h2>

    <li><strong>AdMob</strong>: Serves ads to support the app financially. Ads may be personalized if you grant consent under GDPR.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Crashlytics & Performance Monitoring</strong>: Helps detect crashes, bugs, and performance issues to enhance app stability.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>: Offers insight into anonymous user behavior to inform design and gameplay improvements.</li>
